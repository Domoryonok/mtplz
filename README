How to convert from moses.ini weights to our weights.  Our length feature is just the length without any transform, so to some extent this is removing constants that Moses uses.

MOSES        MTPLZ                 MULTIPLY
WordPenalty0 target_word_insertion -1
LM           lm                    2.30258509299404568401
Distortion0  distortion            -1
Phrase*       phrase_table          1

mtplz does not transform the phrase table.  Moses takes the natural log as it reads.  So take the natural log when converting a phrase table from Moses.
